5. What did each of your collaborators contribute? If you learned something useful from this person, what was it?
ANSWER : We both contributed our knowledge and understanding of the different blocks. Because of the open ended design of the blocks we both had different interpretations of the functioning of the blocks and found logical errors durin the debugging process because of those errors. So it helped to have different perspectives.
